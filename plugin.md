# How to use the plugin.

## As a researcher

As a researcher you can decide between the given options to construct your q-methodology experiment. 
You can define the size of the grid, the names of the files you provide as well as the size of the images. 
Also, you can prepare a custom header and introduction for the experiment, that will appear on top of the grid.



## As a participant

When you participate in the experiment you are presented with a grid (that has a score from -x to +x) where you need to drag and drop the images that you see under the grid.

To place the photos on the grid, you just need to `drag and drop` each of the images to the place of the grid that you decide. 
If you drop an image on an occupied box, the existing image will return at the bottom of the grid, so you can place it again.

If you click on an image, you can see it in enlarged format, to examine it better.

Once you are done, you can hit the Escape [ESC] button and the experiment will move on. 
You can't skip this part of the experiment, so hitting escape before the placing all the photos on the grid, will give you an error message.
