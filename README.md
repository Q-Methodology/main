# Welcome to Q-methodology plugin for JSPsych library. 

**How to use the plugin.**

There are two ways you can use the plugin.

A) using the website [cognition.run](https://www.cognition.run) as a platform to run your experiments or any other online platform [read JSPsych website](https://www.jspsych.org/overview/running-experiments/#hosting-the-experiment-and-saving-the-data) for more on hosting experiments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you lack the technical skills to write Javascript code required to run experiments, we are offering you a [simple constructor](./constructor/constructor) that will help you construct the code you need to use in cognition.run. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, you can find written [instructions](./cognition/cognition) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O628dNA7WCc) on how to use cognition.run to perform your experiments. 
  
  
  
B) set up your own instance, and write your own experiment using the [plugin](./homebrew/homebrew) as one of the trials. 
  
The same constructor, can also be used in your own instance _(with a bit of HTML coding to wrap around the javascript code)_.
