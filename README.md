##Welcome to Q-methodology plugin for JSPsych library. 

**How to use the plugin.**

There are two ways you can use the plugin.

A) using [cognition.run](https://www.cognition.run) as a platform to run your experiments or any other online platform [read JSPsych website for more on hosting experiments](https://www.jspsych.org/overview/running-experiments/#hosting-the-experiment-and-saving-the-data)

B) set up your own instance, and write your own experiment using the plugin as one of the trials. 


If you lack the technical skills to write Javascript code required to run experiments, we are offering you a simple creator that will construct the experiment code you need to use in cognition.run, but it can also be used in your own instance (with a bit of HTML coding to wrap around the javascript code). 

Also, here you can find instructions and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O628dNA7WCc) on how to use cognition.run to do your experiments. 

**N.B.** cognition.run does provide an data saving mechanism that is not easy to manipulate. You will get plenty of data you will have to clean-up before processing the data. 

B) link to existing notes, explain the plugin and the settings.
