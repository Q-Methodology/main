##Welcome to Q-methodology plugin for JSPsych library. 

**How to use the plugin.**

There are two ways you can use the plugin.

A) using cognition.run as a platform to run your experiments (or any other online platform [JSPsych on where to host experiments](https://www.jspsych.org/overview/running-experiments/#hosting-the-experiment-and-saving-the-data) )

B) set up your own instance, and write your own experiment using the plugin as one of the trials. 


If you lack the technical skills to write Javascript code required to run experiments, we are offering you a simple creator that will construct the experiment code you need to use in cognition.run, but it can also be used in your own instance (with a bit of HTML coding to wrap around the javascript code).
