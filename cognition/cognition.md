# Getting around cogntion.run website.

The purpose of this website is to allow users to create and run experiments without the hassle of learning to set-up a server for their jsPsych experiments. 

## list
1. Create an account on the website (free). 
![create account](https://github.com/kernel52/Q-methodology/blob/8e9a5488bed7c13e019a5167727b95e4af5fd247/images/001.jpg "create account")

2. Login and go to your tasks. If you are not redirected, go to the cognition.run website and find the icon go to tasks on the top right. 
![login](https://github.com/kernel52/Q-methodology/blob/a4e978bea7a33c71867add7807bfcc8e9e2efa3e/images/002.PNG "login")


3. This is what we consider your back-end. Where you can manage all of your experiments, and where you have a couple of examples to play around with. 
![back-end](https://github.com/kernel52/Q-methodology/blob/a4e978bea7a33c71867add7807bfcc8e9e2efa3e/images/003.PNG "back-end")

4. For our purposes, we will create a new Task. 
![tasks](https://github.com/kernel52/Q-methodology/blob/a4e978bea7a33c71867add7807bfcc8e9e2efa3e/images/004.PNG "tasks")


In this form, please provide a name for your task, and save, unless you want to check the advanced settings. 
![settings](https://github.com/kernel52/Q-methodology/blob/a4e978bea7a33c71867add7807bfcc8e9e2efa3e/images/005.PNG "settings")

Once you hit save, you are in the control panel of the specific task.
![go to](https://github.com/kernel52/Q-methodology/blob/a4e978bea7a33c71867add7807bfcc8e9e2efa3e/images/006.PNG "go to")

(You can find the link to the experiment, 
that you can share with your participants,
the Design block where you can modify the task and after that the data collection where all the results will be registered and finally an option to delete the task
![design block](https://github.com/kernel52/Q-methodology/blob/a4e978bea7a33c71867add7807bfcc8e9e2efa3e/images/007.jpeg "design block")

Under Design, you can have Configuration (where you have the name of the experiment and the advanced settings) 
The source code where all the code will be added
![design block](https://github.com/kernel52/Q-methodology/blob/a4e978bea7a33c71867add7807bfcc8e9e2efa3e/images/008.jpeg "design block")

then you have two options about Informed concent (in case you need it for your experiments) and collaborators, if you want to share access with someone else. 

Click on the source code and you are in front of the main panel to design your task. 

On the left you will have to choose the version of jsPsych library, [add the necessary files](#images) and the [stimuli]() (in our case, the images you want). 

In the middle (black box) you will paste the code that you have produced from the constructor or you will be able to write your own code (if you know how to code in jsPsych). 

On the right panel you will be able to test your experiment in demo mode. If you don't wan to see this, you can click on disable preview.
